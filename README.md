# Genesis_Hashes
This Python script generates pixel art images based on SHA-256 hashes. Each hash input produces a unique pixel art representation, making it a fun and creative way to visualize cryptographic hashes.

First 256 bitcoin block hashes as pixel art inscribed on bitcoin ordinals.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script (genesis_hash.py).
2. Run the script using Python 3.x.
3. Input the string you want to hash.
The script will generate pixel art based on the SHA-256 hash of your input and save it as a WebP file.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. PIL (Python Imaging Library)

# Usage Example
`python genesis_hash.py`
